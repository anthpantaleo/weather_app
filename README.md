# weather_app

I wanted to make this as simple as possible. While I really enjoy webpack, I don't really love using it too much, and am excited to learn REACT. Since I know it is coming up shortly, and that I only have a couple projects left with just vanilla, I am going to be creating this with just plain vanilla JS, just to solidify some concept and make sure I'm comfortable. I also think I'm going to integrate some sort of weight stlying like old windows css or something from a library that's available.
